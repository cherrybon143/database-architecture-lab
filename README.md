Laboratory Activity: Exploring Database System Architectures
Objective: To understand and implement different database system architectures, focusing on single-tier,
two-tier, and three-tier models.


Architecture Tiers Summary

This project showcases different system architectures and how they were implemented using various technologies. Each architecture serves as an example of how applications can be structured based on complexity and scalability needs.

1. Single-Tier Architecture

-Program Used: Employees (single-tier).py
-Built With: Python (Tkinter for UI, SQLite for database)
-Overview: Everything—the user interface, logic, and database—is packed into a single program.
-Example Application: A simple employee management system where all records are stored and processed in one place.

2. Two-Tier Architecture

-Program Used: Point of Sales (Two-Tier)
-Built With: Python (Tkinter for UI, SQLite for database)
-Overview: The system is split into two parts: the client (frontend) and the database (backend). The frontend communicates directly with the database.
-Example Application: A small POS system where users handle sales transactions and store data in a local database.

3. Three-Tier Architecture

-Program Used: Point of Sales (Three-Tier)
-Backend: Flask (Python) – Manages business logic and database operations.
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Flask-based web UI)
-Built With: Flask (Python), SQLite (database), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)
-Overview: The system is divided into three layers:
-Presentation Layer – The user interface.
-Application Layer – Processes requests and applies business logic.
-Data Layer – Manages data storage and retrieval.
-Example Application: A web-based POS system where the frontend communicates with a Flask API, which then interacts with the database.

-This summary provides a clear breakdown of the architectures used, the technologies involved, and real-world applications of each model.
